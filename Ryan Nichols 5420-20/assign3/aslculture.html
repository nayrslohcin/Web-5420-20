The deaf community is one that values their language.  It is their language that connects them together, and helps them form bonds of unity and friendship.  When I first learned about the culture it opened my, metaphorically, eyes to a whole new world.  When I met my first deaf teacher, who stated that he loved his kids, even though they were hearing, I got a sort of shock to my system.

What did this mean?  Was he serious?  I soon learned that this group of people wanted their children to appreciate and be a part of a culture that they were a part of.  Deaf people do not see themselves as disabled or disadvantaged.  They simply communicate with their hands, and as I learned do so better than those of us who move our lips only.  Deaf people are not limited to only using thier lips to communicate, but they use expression, emotion, passion, and thier whole body to communicate with others.  This communication is the foundation of their culture, and it is what makes that culture rich.
