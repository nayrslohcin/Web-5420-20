    <h3>Mining the web for usage data</h3>
    <p>I agree that user patterns is an excellent way to help design new sites.  It would help the designer of the site to know what works and what does not work.  I would assume that with big data and data scientists coming onto the scene this would be something they are looking at.  The company I work for recently hired a data scientist, and one of his jobs is to take all of that user data and help make sense of it.  Hopefully this information will make its way into the hands of the developers to create sites that are easier to find and use.

<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think that usability testing is important even if it is by someone who would not typically use that site.  If someone who is not a typical user of a specific site can traverse it easily, I think it points to simplicity of design.  It will most likely not tell you everything you need to know, but the user experience data would be useful.</p>
