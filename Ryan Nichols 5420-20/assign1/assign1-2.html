    <h3>Web page design best practices</h3>
    <p>In the study “The Impact of Visual Layout Factors on Performance in Web Pages: A Cross-Language Study,” by Avi Parush et al, he and his counterparts use the foundations of GUI design to discover their impact on web page design.  To do this they held two studies, one using web page searching in Hebrew and the other using eye fixation on web pages in English.  The reason for choosing these two languages was that each are fundamentally different in structure and reading style.  This type of study, using structurally different languages, would make any correlation even stronger.  Each study was measured against four factors: grouping, alignment, density, and the number of links per page.  The measurement used for Hebrew was the time it took to search for what the subjects were given instruction to find.  The shorter time for searching was considered a positive result.  For the English study it was the number of eye fixations that took place on the page.  The fewer eye fixations per page the more positive the result.  The goal was to find out which factors provided the most positive results for searching, and eye fixations comparatively.  The single most important factor they found was the number of links per page.  The fewer the links the better the results, this was the case in both studies.  The second most important factor was alignment.  The combination of both fewer links, and alignment also produced a positive result.  All other factors did not provide a significant positive impact, and in some cases, as with grouping a negative impact was produced.  Their conclusion is that web and GUI based design rules do share some fundamental values, but with the web being less structured, it is okay to stray from those rules when designing web pages.
<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I realized from this article was the difference between the purpose of web design versus GUI design.  Typically GUI design is used to represent an application with a specific purpose.  Whereas web pages are typically used for displaying, and searching for information.  I would think that if this study were to be completed on a web based application the results would be more inline with GUI design rules.  In my own interaction with different web sites I have always been aware of layout, and felt that design plays a vital role in its effectiveness.  I would have thought that grouping would play a more important role, and was surprised to find out it did not and even had a negative effect overall.  The idea that quantity of links is the most important factor was surprising to me.  Although, after reading this it does make sense.  When browsing to a page you are typically looking for the link that will take you to what you are interested in finding.  The more links there are to choose from the longer it takes to chose.  This seems like a fundamental idea of Donders’s reaction time experiment.
