    <h3>How Visual layout affects a user's web performance</h3>
<p>The article “Visual Design Principles Applied To World Wide Web Construction,” by Luck, D. D., et al.,  was published in January of 1997.  It describes the difficulties in publishing websites based on the factors such as different browsers, monitor resolution, computer manufacturers, and lack of standards.  The purpose of their writing this article was to provide a set of ideas to follow to ensure your page can be read effectively by the widest audience possible.  The basic premise was that a site should be visually pleasing and be consistent in its form and layout.  They suggest following good print rules for text, and formatting images in a way that will make them attractive without requiring excessive download times or sizing issues.  The main issue dealt with in this article is the variability of authoring, combined with the variability in consumption.  One suggestion for controlling how a page is viewed is to use images and image maps for all pages.  They point out that this solution comes with its own set of issues, in that image size and layout can cause slowness, and non-functional pages.  In the end they point out the need to validate your page using validation sites, as well as viewing your own site on as many browsers as possible.
<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is quite old compared to how quickly technology changes.  My reason for using it was I wanted to see how much of this applied in today’s internet world.  What I found is that even with our increased download speeds, faster computers, and bigger screens these rules apply as much today as they did back then.  In fact with access to the internet moving from personal computers only to mobile devices it is even more important to make sure your site can be consumed easily.  With so many using the internet for online business the last thing you want to do is discourage users from using your site.  If it is difficult to maneuver and find content it is not just that users will not use your site, but it could destroy your business.  Even though the rules in this article are almost 20 year old, they are just as relevant today as they were when it was written.
