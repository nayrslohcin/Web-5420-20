    <h3>Website Design Process and Responsive Web Design</h3>
    <p>I agree that having a nice design is only the beginning to being able to use a site.  Based on my own experience sites that are hard to navigate are not ones that I frequently use.  If people want users to come back to their site they need to be cognizant of how easy it is for users to find content easily, and how it flows from one place to another.  Also based on your comments it seems to me that the aesthetics of a page are completely irrelevant to a functioning site.  What I get from this is that the focus of a site from the start should be on function, and the aesthetic part should come after the site has proven to be easily used.

<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On your second article on responsiveness I think this is the most important part of a site.  With the speeds that people have at their homes, on their phones, and almost everywhere it is imperative that a site is responsive.  We live in a world that is moving ever faster and people, just as you mentioned yourself, will move on to another website, if the one they click on initially does not respond within seconds of a click.</p>
